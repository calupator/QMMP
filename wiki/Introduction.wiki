QMMP is a media player for the Linux desktop environment.  It is based upon Qt4.  Also, it is a player that is designed to be a Linux replacement for WinAmp, and was even designed to be able to use the WinAmp2 skins, as well as those from XMMS.  Anyone who has used WinAmp will be able to start using QMMP right away and feel right at home.

QMMP will play mp3 files, streaming Internet media, and other types of local or remote audio formats.

The program is designed and owned by Vladimir  Kuznetsov (vovanec), Ilya Kotov (trailuser02), and  Uriy Zhuravlev (stalkerg); all of whom are involved in other projects as well.
