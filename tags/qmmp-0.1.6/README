If someone module doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
in qmmp.pri file - just comment corresponding line( symbol '#').
Attention! By default all modules are enabled.

Also you can use cmake for building and installation (for testing only).

make install

If someone module doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it by running:
cmake ./ -D USE_JACK:BOOL=FALSE
This command will disable JACK Plugin for example. Available options:
USE_MAD, USE_MPC, USE_VORBIS, USE_FFMPEG, USE_FLAC, USE_ALSA, USE_JACK.
Also you can use ccmake for changing plugins configuration.
By default programm will be installed in /usr/local. You can change default path by running:
cmake ./ -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_path

Attention! By default all modules are enabled.

Changing shared library install path (needed by some 64-bit distributions).
By default, all libraries and plugins will be installed in $(INSTALL PREFIX)/lib. You can change "lib" 
to "lib64" by running qmake-qt4 or cmake with special parameter:
qmake-qt4 LIB_DIR=/lib64
or
cmake ./ -D LIB_DIR=lib64
