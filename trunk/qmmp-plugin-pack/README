Plugin pack is a set of extra plugins for Qmmp.
Official home page: http://qmmp.ylsoftware.com/

Description:
- MPG123: provides MPEG v1/2 layer1/2/3 support with use of libmpg123 library
- Simple Ui: simple user interface based on standard widgets set

Requirements:
- OS GNU Linux
- Qt >= 4.6
- qmmp >= 0.6
- libmpg123 (Optional)
- cmake >= 2.8.0 (for build only)


Attention! Plugin Pack build needs lrelease installed. The libqt4-devel package often contains this utility.

Configure:
cmake ./

Build:
make

Installation:
make install

If someone plugin (for example, MPG123 plugin) doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
by running:
cmake ./ -DUSE_MPG123:BOOL=FALSE

Available options:
- USE_MPG123; USE_SIMPLE


Also you can use ccmake for changing plugins configuration.
By default program will be installed in /usr/local. You can change default path by running:
cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_path


In some cases, you can use qmake for building and installation.

Configure:
qmake

Build:
make

Installation:
make install INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local


If someone module doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
in qmmp-plugin-pack.pri file - just comment corresponding line( symbol '#').
Attention! By default all plugins are enabled by default.

Changing shared library install path (needed by some 64-bit distributions).
By default, all libraries and plugins will be installed to $(INSTALL PREFIX)/lib. You can change "lib"
to "lib64" by running qmake-qt4 or cmake with special parameter:
qmake-qt4 LIB_DIR=/lib64
or
cmake ./ -DLIB_DIR=lib64


To avoid some problems please read below carefully.

How to enable MPG123 plugin.
By default libmad-based mpeg plugin has higher priority than mpg123.
To fix this go to the settings->plugins and disable "MPEG plugin".
