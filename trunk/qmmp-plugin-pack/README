If someone plugin (for example, XMP plugin) doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
by running the following command:
cmake ./ -DUSE_XMP:BOOL=FALSE

Available options:
- USE_FFAP, USE_XMP, USE_SRC, USE_GOOM, USE_FFVIDEO, USE_YTB (plugins)
- USE_ASM (assembler-level optimizations inside FFap decoder)

Also you can use ccmake to change plugin configuration.
By default program will be installed in /usr/local. You can change default path by running:
cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_path

For more information see GNUInstallDirs module documentation:
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html


In some cases, you can use qmake for building and installation.

Configure:
qmake PREFIX=custom_path (default: /usr)

Build:
make

Installation:
make install

If someone module doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it in qmmp-plugin-pack.pri file - just comment
corresponding line( symbol '#') or execute qmake with the special parameters:
qmake DISABLED_PLUGINS+=XMP_PLUGIN DISABLED_PLUGINS+=FFAP_PLUGIN

Attention! By default all plugins are enabled by default.

Changing shared library install path (for some 64-bit distributions).
By default, all libraries and plugins will be installed to $(INSTALL PREFIX)/lib. You can change "lib"
to "lib64" by running qmake or cmake with the special parameter:
qmake LIB_DIR=/usr/lib64
or
cmake ./ -DLIB_DIR=lib64
