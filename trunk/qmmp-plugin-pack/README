Attention! Plugin Pack build needs lrelease installed.

Configure:

Build:
make

Installation:
make install

If someone plugin (for example, MPG123 plugin) doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
by running the following command:
cmake ./ -DUSE_MPG123:BOOL=FALSE

Available options:
- UUSE_MPG123, USE_FFAP, USE_XMP, USE_SRC, USE_GOOM, USE_FFVIDEO, USE_HISTORY (plugins)
- USE_ASM (assembler-level optimizations inside FFap decoder)


Also you can use ccmake to change plugin configuration.
By default program will be installed in /usr/local. You can change default path by running:
cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_path


In some cases, you can use qmake for building and installation.

Configure:
qmake

Build:
make

Installation:
make install INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local

If someone module doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it in qmmp-plugin-pack.pri file - just comment
corresponding line( symbol '#') or execute qmake with the special parameters:
qmake DISABLED_PLUGINS+=XMP_PLUGIN DISABLED_PLUGINS+=FFAP_PLUGIN

Attention! By default all plugins are enabled by default.

Changing shared library install path (for some 64-bit distributions).
By default, all libraries and plugins will be installed to $(INSTALL PREFIX)/lib. You can change "lib"
to "lib64" by running qmake (qmake-qt4) or cmake with the special parameter:
qmake LIB_DIR=/lib64
or
cmake ./ -DLIB_DIR=lib64
