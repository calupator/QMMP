               PyQMMP - Python Bindings for the QMMP Library


INTRODUCTION

These are the Python bindings for the QMMP library.  You must also have
PyQt and the SIP Python bindings generator installed.

The homepage of PyQt is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/.

The homepage of SIP is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/.


INSTALLATION

The first step is to configure PyQMMP by running the following command.

	python configure.py (PyQMMP directory should be placed in lib/ directory of QMMP source tree)

If you have multiple versions of Python installed then make sure you use the
interpreter for which you wish to generate bindings for.

The configure.py script takes many options.  Use the "-h" command line option
to display a full list of the available options.

The next step is to build PyQMMP using your platform's make command.

	make

The final step is to install PyQMMP by running the following command.
(Depending on your system you may require root or administrator privileges.)

	make install
